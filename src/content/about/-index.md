A content writer with 5+ years of experience across brand identity, publishing, and digital products.

I've written SEO-optimized posts that continue to rank on Google and drive organic traffic.

Over the years, I’ve worked with more than 100 clients—helping them market their tools and grow online.

Currently, I’m building AI products, sharing insights on automation, and writing a weekly newsletter on Substack.
