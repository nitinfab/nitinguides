Hey there,

Just so you know—I don’t collect any of your personal data.

This blog exists to help you discover the best AI tools and show you how to use them to boost productivity. That’s it. No email signups, no tracking forms, no hidden agendas.

I don’t store your information, and I have no interest in doing so.

That said, this website may use basic tools like Google Analytics to understand what content performs well. These tools collect anonymous data—like what pages were visited or how long someone stayed. It helps me improve the site, not invade your privacy.

If you ever have questions, feel free to reach out at "nitfab0@gmail.com".

Thanks for reading and being here.
