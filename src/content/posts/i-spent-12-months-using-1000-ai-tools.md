If you [follow me](https://substack.com/@nitinfab), you may know that I've been trying a number of AI tools every day.

I started using most of the popular AI tools from the time they were first released.

Yes, I have been using ChatGPT from the day I got to know about it - the same goes for other AI tools like Cursor, CodeRabbit, and similar popular ones.

And the best part? To write new posts about the best AI tools, I've been using a number of new tools every week.

Now, I won't lie - this AI journey hasn't been easy.

It takes hours and hours of learning every day to find the best AI tools, use them to see whether they work, and then write about the best ones.

And now, I want to share some of the best AI tools that I literally use every day.

> **Note:** This post contains no affiliate links, so when you try an AI tool, I won't be making a single penny. My only intention with this post is to provide value - and if you find something helpful, you can subscribe to my newsletter.

With that said, let's get started.

### 1. ChatGPT

Without any doubt, I need to add ChatGPT in the #1 position.

I know everyone knows about ChatGPT, but still, most people don't use it the way one needs to. You can literally ask about anything - from building your health to creating wealth.

Recently, I wanted to start something fresh, so I gave a prompt to ChatGPT:

> I've been writing on Medium for the last 5 years. And now, I deleted that account and want to start something fresh. I was a web developer, an expert content writer, and now I'm learning about AI. What do you think I should start? I'm open to everything.Take your time and suggest the best option that can give results in at least 6 months.

And here's what it responded:

Let me tell you - I'm doing the same. I've created [a Substack newsletter](https://aimadesimple0.substack.com/), my [personal website](https://www.nitinguides.com/), and [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@aimoneyminded).

The same way, one can use it to build apps in any niche, generate marketing campaigns, build side hustles, businesses, take guidance on any topic, and much more.

### 2. Canva

We all know Canva as a tool that can help in creating invoices, resumes, PPTs, videos, and more.

Well, the Canva team has even launched a number of AI features that you can use right inside the Canva tool.

And that's what makes it super useful.

As you can see, you can generate code, images, videos, designs, and more with the help of Canva.

Along with that, Canva provides an AI-powered photo editor, background generator, AI voices for your videos, image generation, custom mockup templates, and much more.

Not only that, you can use [Magic Write](https://www.canva.com/magic-write/) right inside Canva Docs to generate content. Then we have Magic Design to generate designs the way you want, Magic Edit to edit with ease, and much more.

If you want to know more about the AI features it provides, simply visit this link to learn more.

I've been finding it literally useful and productive right inside Canva, and so I use it almost daily.

### 3. Leonardo AI

Let me tell you, as a content writer, I need to find the best images for my blog posts.

And well, Unsplash, Pexels, and other websites have the same images, and I got bored.

So, I started using [Leonardo AI](https://leonardo.ai/) (one of the best AI image generators out there).

With this, you can generate high-quality and realistic images for advertising, product photography, marketing, concept art, character design, and more.

Not only that, but you can even use their real-time canvas, real-time generation feature, and even generate videos along with the latest Veo 3 model.

To get started, simply visit [their](https://leonardo.ai/) website and click on the button "Get Started" to create your account.

After that, you can generate images by selecting the specific models, and more.

Talking about the pricing - it provides a free plan (yes, I'm still on the free plan, and it gets my work done).

Also, as you can see, it even provides a number of paid plans as well, with more features.

### 4. ElevenLabs

If you follow me, you may know that I've started my YouTube channel, and I'm learning to create videos and publish them online.

And I don't like my voice much. Also, I want the audio to be clear without any background noise, and more.

So, I used a number of AI voice generators, and I loved [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) a lot to try.

![Source: ElevenLabs](/images/posts/post2/8.png)

To get started, simply visit [their](https://elevenlabs.io/) website and click on the button "Sign Up" to create your account.

And then use it to generate AI voiceovers by writing text in your specific AI voice.

And if you want to use more, you can go with any of the paid plans.

### 5. Google AI Studio

Well, to be honest, I'm using [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) more than Gemini.

The reason is I believe it is much better and has more functionalities that are helping me in everyday life.

![Source: Google AI Studio](/images/posts/post2/10.png)

To get started, simply visit the "[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)" website and sign in with Google to get started.

And then you can ask Google Studio anything, and it will answer your questions, summarize texts, write different kinds of creative content, and more.

Also, just see the right tab in the above image - here, you can customize the settings the way you want. And if you want to learn something, you can share your screen, and it will give you the info in real time.

Thanks to this, you can build apps even without being a programmer, learn a complex tool by sharing your screen, learn video editing, ask queries related to anything, and more.

![Source: Google AI Studio](/images/posts/post2/12.png)

Not only that, but you can even generate images, speech, songs, and even videos with Google AI Studio.

And the best part? It's completely free to use.

### 6. NotebookLM

Now, let's be honest - we all are learning something new to make ourselves smarter.

- If you are a student, you may be learning some subjects to master them.
- If you are a programmer, you may be learning some new programming languages or concepts to build something.
- If you are a content creator, you may be learning something new to write about or to create a video.
- And so on.

And for that, we all know the usual process - which is a lot more tedious and takes too much time.

Well, that's where I use [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) to make my learning process a lot simpler and easier.

![Source: NotebookLM](/images/posts/post2/13.png)

To get started, you just need to visit [their](https://notebooklm.google/) website and click on the button "Try NotebookLM".

Then you just need to create a new notebook, upload the source - and that's all.

![Source: NotebookLM](/images/posts/post2/14.png)

I've tried uploading the famous book "Rich Dad, Poor Dad", and then I can start chatting about what I want to ask specifically, create a podcast related to that, and also a mind map based on the source uploaded.

Here's the mind map it created from the source I uploaded:

### 7. Perplexity

Well, I think this one is the last AI tool that I use almost every day.

And since I'm a content creator, I mostly use Perplexity to get the latest info, learn about new AI news, and more.

To be more specific, I ask [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) for the latest news in AI, and then it provides me the best news along with the sources.

![Source: Perplexity](/images/posts/post2/16.png)

And then I pick a few, read them, and write content to publish on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinfab/) and [Substack](https://substack.com/@nitinfab) accounts.

Other than that, I use their "Discover" feature a lot to read the latest news in multiple niches.

Lastly, sometimes, when I want to do deep research on a specific topic, I come to Perplexity again - thanks to their feature.
