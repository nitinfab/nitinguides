If you follow me, you may know that I've been a web developer for over 5 years.

To be more precise, I started my career as a web developer and have built multiple websites in different categories for my clients and as an employee.

Earlier, there was no ChatGPT or Gemini to help, so I had to write each and every line of code by myself, which was too tedious.

Fast forward to today, we have ChatGPT and similar LLM tools to help you with literally every task.

And now, I was thinking of building a blog website for myself which I have full control over, can rank on Google, and for more reasons.

So I went to ChatGPT and started my research to build a blog website for me.

### Step 1: Researching the best and simplest tech stack

Since I'm a web developer, I have the expertise to ask ChatGPT clearly about what I want and even build a blog myself.

But I want to act as a noob and ask ChatGPT about the easiest way possible.

And I've given a specific prompt like this:

> I'm a web developer, and I want to create a blog website with the goal of ranking on Google. I've tried Medium and Substack, but due to their policies, I don't want to continue using them.

Can you suggest some other options - like cloning a specific GitHub repository or using a platform - that can help my articles rank easily on Google?

And here are the options it came up with:
```
Option 1: Clone a GitHub Blog Starter Repo (Fastest to Set Up)

1. Next.js Blog Starter,
2. Astro Theme - AstroPaper, 
3. Hugo - PaperMod Theme

Option 2: Use WordPress (If You Want GUI + Plugins)

Option 3: Use Ghost CMS (Beautiful & SEO Friendly)

Bonus Tip: Use Static Site + GitHub + Vercel/Netlify
```

Further, I asked ChatGPT to suggest me the best option out of these using this prompt: 

> Which is the best option to help me set up the website easily and rank on Google without any issues? Yes, I have the expertise in writing content and ranking on Google.

And here's what it said:

And I went ahead with this option.

If you ask me, this is one of the best ways to create your website to rank on Google.

### Step 2: Building my blog website (step-by-step)

Now, I want to build my blog website using Astro, so I asked ChatGPT to provide me the steps required.

And here are the 8 steps it provided:

As you can see, it provided me everything from the prerequisites to the steps about cloning the blog, running locally, editing the settings, deploying to Vercel, and more.

Well, I have cloned a different theme from Astro to build my website.

And the best part? ChatGPT even provided me the steps to submit the sitemap to Google Search Console to get started on Google.

### Step 3: Handling errors, and making the website live

You know, as a web developer, it was easy for me to clone a repo and run the blog website.

But if you don't have a clear understanding, you can ask ChatGPT to provide a more in-depth guide about how to clone the GitHub repo and more.

Also, when you get some errors, you can simply copy that error and ask ChatGPT how to solve it.

When I was running the local file, I got an error, and I asked ChatGPT.

And it gave me the correct reason along with a simple solution.

Thanks to this process, I successfully deployed my website on Vercel and bought a domain from Namecheap.

Then I asked ChatGPT whether it knows how to set the DNS records for my website.

And let me tell you, it gave me the right steps I needed to follow.

Thanks to that, I've made my website live, and here's my website link.

### Step 4: Ranking on Google

As you can see, my website is live, and now I just want to go through a couple of processes to let Google crawl my website and rank it.

And for that, ChatGPT was kind enough to suggest all the steps.

You see, it told me to set my primary domain, submit the site to Google Search Console, submit the sitemap to Google, and much more.

To be precise, ChatGPT provided me every process in a step-by-step guide, and it was easy for me to follow.

At the time of creating the sitemap, it made an error which I told it, and it fixed it.

And thanks to that, I've made my website crawlable by Google and rank on Google.

Now, my focus is simply to write informative and valuable content that will help me rank on Google without any issues.

### Let's wrap up

You know, this was probably the simplest example I've ever shared. But that's the point - I wanted to show you how easy it can be.

I just asked ChatGPT the right questions, followed the steps it gave me, fixed a few small errors with its help, and my blog website was live, ranking-ready, and fully under my control.

And in the same way, you can use tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini to build whatever you want. It can be a full-fledged app, a complex game, a portfolio site, or even something more advanced.

Not just websites - you can also build AI automations, systems to handle your daily work, content workflows, client tools, and more.

And the best part? You don't need to know everything from scratch. 
You just need to know how to ask and how to follow through.

This is the future. And the ones who know how to use these tools properly?

They're going to move way faster than everyone else. So take this as a starting point, and try it out.

Hope you like it.

That's it - thanks.
